## Luxe - E-commerce Application

Welcome to **Luxe**, a modern e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless shopping and selling experience. Built with a focus on user-friendly interfaces and robust backend functionality, Luxe allows users to browse products, manage carts, and sellers to list and track their products and orders. This README provides an overview, setup instructions, and usage details for the project.

# Overview

Luxe is an e-commerce application featuring:

- User Features: Browse products, add to cart, and proceed to checkout.
- Seller Features: List products, view listed products, and track ordered products with buyer details.
- Responsive Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS, featuring a sleek aesthetic (e.g., bg-white/80, backdrop-blur-lg, purple/pink gradients).
- State Management: Utilizes Redux for managing product and cart states.
- Authentication: JWT-based authentication for secure user and seller actions.
- Real-time Updates: Local storage synchronization for offline access.

**The project is divided into a frontend (React) and backend (Node.js/Express with MongoDB), with APIs for product and order management.**

# Usage

**User Features**

3. **Checkout:** Proceed to the checkout page from the cart to complete an order.

**Seller Features**

1. **Add Products:** Use the "Add New Product" button on the seller products page to create listings.
2. **View Listed Products:** Access the "Listed Products" tab to see and manage your products (edit or delete).
3. **View Ordered Products:** Switch to the "Ordered Products" tab to see details of purchased items, including buyer name, email, quantity, order status, and date.

# Authentication

Log in to access cart management and seller features. Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page with a toast notification.
